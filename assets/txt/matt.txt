    The Labor Union Movement is an ever-evolving organism that has been influencing the United States and the world in a positive way. The movement has deep roots in U.S. history and has grown into a tool that allows for fairness and necessary change in a work environment. 
    The Labor Union Movement had a big spike in the 1980’s. “In the late summer of 1981, federal air traffic controllers cooperated on a nationwide strike after their union failed to accept the U.S. government’s offer for a new contract,” (Mcneese 145). The FAA had failed to meet PATCO’s reasonable expectations and for that, these controllers across the country agreed that what had happened was wrong. The government’s response to this (at the time) illegal act was to issue a “back-to-work” order.  “Although the government issued a “back-to-work” order, the majority of the country’s 13,000 striking air controllers continued their walkout,” (Mcneese 145). These workers preserved over a government order issued by the President of the United States because they deeply believed that change was necessary even if what they fought turned out to be a failure. With Regan's firing of 11,359 air-traffic controllers, the labor movement took a major blow not only to their principles but as a force for worker empowerment. The Air Traffic controller strike represents weakening labor and union power in a new era of capital dominance that would persist after Reagan's Risky actions that ultimately paid off for the US Government. In the wake of such a blow to union power, questions of the validity, necessity, and actual power of the unions would be at the forefront of workers' minds. Would this spell the end of labor in America?
    Thankfully, labor would not die out under Reagan's iron fist but blossom again in the 21st century with the Starbucks movements. The Starbucks Union movement has been so triumphant they have challenged the post Reagan society, bringing into question if the whole nation could see a labor revolution (Logan). The Starbucks movement, however, has done more than challenged the status quo but reaffirmed the deep roots and necessity of Labor power in the US. There is a common fallacy to view history as bending left, as an inevitability that progress will always occur but this is not true. The history of labor unions reflects this bending of progress with the counter movement of Reagan met with the hard work of everyday Americans who use every tool at their disposal to work for a more fair society. History bends towards progress because of people like the workers at the Starbucks cafes who make the US a more fair and reasonable place.
