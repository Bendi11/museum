    Since its founding, America has been shaped by the labor movement. Early in the country’s history, many small bands of workers would form in local communities in order to increase their collective bargaining power with an employer, however no centralized and nationwide organization existed prior to the late 19th century. One such organization was the American Federation of Labor, founded in 1886 with the goal of collecting many unions into a federation in order to more effectively further their collective interests. The AFL organized thousands of strikes in the 1890s, supporting an eight hour workday as opposed to the then-standard ten. The labor movement was often intertwined with other social movements, like the Women’s Trade Union League established in 1903. The League was dedicated to improving the conditions of working women, and supported the AFL. Following a fire in a locked clothing factory leading to 146 deaths; mostly women, the Women’s Trade Union League pushed for and achieved regulations requiring additional fire safety guarantees in the workplace.

    During the Great Depression, workers suffered as companies cut wages and fired employees in order to stay afloat. Organizations such as the United Mine Workers were formed, and by 1955 over 12 million workers belonged to a labor union (“Rise of Organized Labor” 10). The growth of unions was hampered by anti-labor regulations like the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. The act stripped workers unions of much of their bargaining power, allowing states to individually pass Right-to-Work laws which could prohibit unions from forming contractual agreements with employers regarding their ability to add members. To this day, so-called ‘closed shop’ policies requiring an employee to hire union members exclusively are outlawed. 
    In more modern times, union membership has diminished, in part due to the passage of anti-union laws. However, as international megacorporations like Amazon exploit their employees and disregard their safety (“What do workers demand from Amazon?” 5), interest in union membership has increased. In addition, rising wealth and income inequality (“The Facts that Define Our Grand Divides”) has spurred many workers to protest for increased salaries and post-retirement benefits that they were deprived of before.
