    The labor movement has perhaps been the most transformative social movement in the United States. The effects of achievements earned and pushback received by the movement are still felt in modern America, and contribute to many of the social problems we face today. Although labor unions began when America began, it did not grow into an organized nationwide movement until the late 19th century. 
    One important example of a transformation in US society caused by the labor movement is the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire. Workers were locked inside their sweatshop making clothing when a fire broke out, killing 146 people in total as the building lacked fire protection devices like sprinklers. The uproar of the public following the gruesome scene and the collective action of the Women’s Trade Union League led to the passage of additional fire safety measures in the workplace (“Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire”). In another major example of long-reaching effects, the eight hour workday was the primary focus of many labor movements in the late nineteenth century (“Haymarket”)- leading to Congress passing a bill requiring a maximum eight-hour workday for federal employees in 1868 and further advances like the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
    Unfortunately, the passage of anti-union legislation like the Taft-Hartley Act of 1935 has led to a stark decline in union membership. Many states have so-called ‘right to work’ laws in place severely limiting the ability of unions to organize and petition for change. Recent developments like the Amazon Labor Union have alerted many to the current state of labor in the U.S., but there remains many issues yet to be addressed.
