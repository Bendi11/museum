    The Labor Unions Movement has been both an important piece of history and reflection of modern day in America. It shows the struggles and hardships that the common man or woman faces each day, as those with higher power and wealth look down with neither compassion nor empathy. 
The movement has seen lots of support, but just as much opposition. Republican presidents such as President Reagan and Trump have opposed the organization of unions, while President Biden has been adamant about supporting the unions. Reagan has opposed union actions like the Air Traffic Controllers Strike, commenting that, “Government cannot close down the assembly line, it has to provide without interruption the protective services which are Government's reason for being,” (Reagan). On the opposite spectrum, Biden plans to support the unions, and has been “strengthening public and private sector unions and helping all workers bargain successfully for what they deserve,” (Biden) This struggle between the two sides shows how much those who believe in the movement have had to fight for what they believe in.
    The entire purpose of the movement is to give rights to the people who need them, not unlike movements meant to help minorities. Both strive to look out for the little guy, and because of this they have often come together to help the other. There have been plenty of examples of this throughout history such as the Delano Grape Boycott done by Filipinos and Mexicans, or Martin Luther King speaking on the importance of common labor force, saying that, “If America does not use her vast resources of wealth to end poverty and make it possible for all of God’s children to have the basic necessities of life, she, too, will go to hell,” (King). Even when looking at modern day protests, you can see people of different genders and races coming together. They all seek one thing, to enforce the values that America was founded on, to fight for equality and opportunity for all. It’s clear that the Labor Unions Movement not only speaks on the state of American common labor, but also on the need for the core beliefs of America to be given to all, no matter what race or class someone may be.
